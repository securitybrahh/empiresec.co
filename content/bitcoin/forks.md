# What is a bitcoin fork?

Miners v. node runners v. users v. client v. software v. entitiy

Mempool policy v. drivechain v. Extention Block

The block Size wars, UASF - User Activated Soft Fork {the miners making some soft fork so the node runners did a soft fork to invalidate their soft fork?} 

Before I was familiar with bitcoin, forking usually meant forking the coidebase but in bitcoin its a different story.

"So, what happened was the miners were allowed to signal first. By waiting for miners to indicate a Taproot majority, a scenario where nodes failed to upgrade to a majority, say it remained around 50:50"
