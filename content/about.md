1.  Choose Subject line carefully, as most will be ignored based on just that.
2.  Search before ask.
3.  Low quality questions will be ignored.
4.  Long Questions will be ignored, limit yourself to 3-4 lines. Add a TLDR and PS if sending long, those will decide if I want to read it.
5.  Send me any reviews on my products, will love to hear them.
