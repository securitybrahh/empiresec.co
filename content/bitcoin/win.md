# This is how bitcoin will Win

### Gun is Law

Code is free speech, enforcement can only be done via threat of violence.

### Central bank

Bitcoin HAS replaced central banks they just don't know that yet.

### Banks

For bitcoin banks to exist you need: 

1. no central bank (btc is global "central" bank) 
2. no legal tender (ppl decide, not gov) 
3. crypto-friendly legislation (Gun is law)

Only El Salvador and Panama seems to be places for bitcoin banks rn.

Sad.

### Company Ledgers

We need a sidechain that protects privacy of unit of accounts of companies, liquid is a federation not a sidechain.

Post Liquid - A better porotocol on top of or side of the bitcoin chain, as bitcoin as the underlying asset in the Censensus. 
`Who can peg out? Public can not independently peg-out, which means they require from a Federation member to convert L-BTC back to BTC`

Also companies need to have privacy if btc is accepted as unit of account, albeit some info can be in black and white (btc) {countries have portals for disclosures, filings etc} 

### Inter-country Settlements

"""

1. Investment firm VanEck has confirmed that China and Russia are now settling energy transactions using BTC, ditching the US dollar system amid rising global friction. 

2. Nations like Bolivia are also exploring crypto for power imports, while French utility EDF eyes Bitcoin mining. 

3. Investors and analysts are highlighting Bitcoinâ€™s growing appeal as a non-debasable asset and a hedge against currency devaluation, noting it cannot be manipulated by governments in uncertain economic times.
