To use WhatsApp as privately as possible:

1.  Don’t invite meta ai bot in groups   
2.  Switch off notifications  
3.  Use Graphene OS contact scopes or don’t give any contact, maybe use inbuilt contacts
4.  Disable when not using 
5.  Don’t use payments   
6.  Don’t use the business app, only the consumer app  
7.  Maybe Don’t use Google e2ee backups (make local backup and move it from android directory to new Mobile)   
8.  Switch on privacy toggle in each personal chat  
9.  Can use [https://faq.whatsapp.com/764072925284841/](https://faq.whatsapp.com/764072925284841/)
    
Notes:
