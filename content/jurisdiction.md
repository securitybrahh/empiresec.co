Territorial countries: In these countries, foreign-source income is not taxed, even if it is brought to or used in the country. Salary does not count as foreign income, dividends do.
GeoArbitrage: Earning in a first world currency (USD, EUR, GBP etc) and spending in 3rd world country (Pesos etc.)

Flag Theory: “Go where you are treated best”. If you are paying 40% tax and getting the best infra, environment and people. You shouldn’t mind the taxes but if you are getting nothing of value for huge taxes, it’s best to vote with your feet by moving to a jurisdiction where you are treated best. I would keep an eye on “The Free Private Cities” Movement 

Country of Origin: Where you were born and raised.

Citizen: “A legal status and relation between an individual and a state that entails specific legal rights and duties.” Often by birth on soil.

Notary: Verified and authenticated by your local authorities for domestic use.

Apostille: Verified and authenticated by your local authorities for international use.

There is something called Jurat, mainly for face-to-face and physical verification. But I haven’t really seen that asked in the wild.

Resident: Mainly depends on the duration of stay and sometimes income generated though the country and total foreign income.

1.	Temporary: People often apply for this to start the clock.
2.	Permanent: After x years, you get to be treated almost as a citizen at least on paper.
3.	Virtual Residency (palau)

Tax Resident: This is used to obtain a tax ID that can be used as an identity buffer for products and services. You don’t have to visit the country much and get tax benefits.

Tax Exit: Gracefully exiting your country so that it doesn’t trouble you in the future. If people don’t want to exit (and still pay 0 taxes to home country), they often report wrong income or don’t file anything. That’s risky but often works.

Naturalization: process by which a non-national in a country acquires nationality, often depends on the duration of stay, study of the culture (and language acquisition) and series of tests.

Visa: It’s the permission to cross the border, they basically want to see if you are fit to enter their country. Different types:

1.	Tourist visa (pleasure/travel visas): Only x (6) months of residence allowed in 1 year.
2.	Immigration and naturalization visas (including by marriage): Obtained to acquire citizenship in the future.
3.	Student visas (for studying abroad): Obtained after getting into a foreign university.
4.	Business or work visas (for working, which include both non-immigrant and immigrant types): You get this if you got a job in a foreign company.

Depending on the relationship between the 2 countries, these are different ways to obtain tourist visa:

1.	Visa on Arrival: This is the best kind; you just need to sign your time of arrival when you reach the other country and pay some fees.
2.	eVisa: You provide the relevant documents on the gov’s site and the application is processed fully online.
3.	Visa through appointment in the embassy: This is the most difficult, you essentially have to give an interview in addition to the docs.

Visa often depends on:

1.	Savings account balance and other assets.
2.	Monthly income (and if it’s from dividends)

Offshore Bank: A bank account obtained in a foreign country, often for international money mobility, protection and tax benefits.

Overseas Business: A business setup in a foreign country. Legitimized by office lease and employees.

Community: If you really want to become a perpetual nomad, the communities you participate in, are very important.

Perpetual Traveler: You don’t spend more than 2-4 months (depends on the country) in any country so that they can’t claim any taxes from you.

PPP: A product has different pricing in different regions to have more sales.

Cost of living: Basket of basic needs and necessities cost differently in different regions.

Infra of the country: This is why you pay tax.

Territorial: income in relationship to residency.

Real Estate: It is for asset protection not Growth/appreciation.

Money is funneled into the country and parked in empty housing.

Previously how much land you controlled mattered a lot but in information economy, how much traffic you control matters more.

More Land is often not proportional to more power these days.
